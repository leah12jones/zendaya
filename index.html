          <h2>Zendaya Suits Up at Vanity Fair Oscar Party 2022</h2>
<p>
          Zendaya changed into her second look of the night to attend the 2022 Vanity Fair Oscar Party! The 25-year-old actress looked so chic at the after party on Sunday night (March 27) at the Wallis Annenberg Center for the Performing Arts in Beverly Hills, Calif. Zendaya looked incredible earlier in the night while attending the Oscars ceremony to support her movie Dune, which won several awards.

        <p>The Dune star took to Instagram on Tuesday, March 29, to share an uber-glam red carpet photo that put her silver smoky eye on fully display. While her beauty was breathtaking, it was her caption that blew Us away.

          “Every now and then I do my own beat,” she captioned the image, which put her glowy skin, pink lip and metallic eye on full display. To get the look, Zendaya, who stunned in a Valentino set, used a full lineup of Lancôme products. </p>

        <p>Born on September 1, 1996, in Oakland, California, actress and singer Zendaya came from a theatrical background. As the daughter of a stage manager, she spent much of her youth hanging around the California Shakespeare Theater. She also trained in its youth program and appeared in some of its productions.

          During her days as a student at the Oakland School for the Arts, Zendaya landed a number of roles in local theatrical productions. She also honed her craft at the American Conservatory Theater and the Cal Shakes Conservatory. Zendaya had an interest in dance as well. She was a member of the Future Shock Oakland dance group for several years and studied hula dancing at the Academy of Hawaiian Arts.

          In addition to her theatrical work, Zendaya had some early success as a model, working for companies such as Macy’s and Old Navy. For a Sears commercial, Zendaya performed as a backup dancer for Selena Gomez. She eventually decided to use only her first name professionally. “Zendaya” means “to give thanks” in the language of the Shona people of Zimbabwe. </p>

        <p> In 2010 Zendaya saw her career take off with the debut of Shake It Up on the Disney Channel. The then-14-year-old performer described the show to McClatchy-Tribune Business News as “a buddy comedy about two best friends who dream of becoming professional dancers and finally get their chance when they get to audition for their favorite show.”

          Outside of her hit show, Zendaya lent her voice to the animated television movie Pixie Hollow Games (2011). She also made guest appearances on such series as A.N.T. Farm and Good Luck Charlie, and starred with Thorne in the 2012 television movie Frenemies.

          Distancing herself from her Disney image, Zendaya signed on for the starring role of Rue in the HBO series Euphoria. Based on the turbulent adolescent years of creator Sam Levinson, the show generated buzz ahead of its June 2019 debut for its graphic depictions of teen drug use and sexuality.

          Other significant projects that Zendaya has been involved with include: Spider-Man: No Way Home, Dune. Spider-Man: Homecoming, Spider-Man- Far from Home, The Greatest Showman, Malcom & Marie, Dancing with the Stars, Smallfoot

          With a major award and a new Valentino partnership, Zendaya’s status as a veritable fashion icon is undeniable – and it’s been this way for a while. The multi-hyphenate has us accustomed to daringly experimental looks that she always seems to somehow look killer in — no matter how elaborate or over-the-top they may be. From the array of hairstyles she’s tried out over the last few years to her well-documented penchant for epic suits, there’s nothing Z can’t pull off.

          And the best part? That’s how her sartorial game has always been. Even as a young Disney star, way before Malcolm & Marie and Euphoria, the performer took major fashion risks and was never a snooze to look at on the red carpet. Don’t believe us?
